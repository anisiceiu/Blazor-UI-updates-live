# Blazor-UI-updates-live
Whenever a row is inserted, updated, or deleted in a SQL Server table, the Blazor UI updates live â€” for example, an item list, dashboard counter, or notification panel updates instantly.

ðŸ”· 2. The Best Approach: SQL Dependency + SignalR

The most reliable and scalable way to achieve this:

Use SqlDependency or SqlTableDependency in your backend (C#/.NET) to get notified when data changes in SQL Server.

Use SignalR to push those notifications in real time to all connected Blazor clients.

In Blazor, listen to those SignalR messages and refresh the UI.

* Requires SQL Server Broker enabled:
  
ALTER DATABASE YourDb SET ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
